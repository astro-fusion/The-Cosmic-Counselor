# Gratitude Constellation {.unnumbered}

Looking back on the journey that brought this book to life, I feel deeply grateful. This book is the result of my life's experiences and wouldn't be possible without the incredible support from the people who shaped me.

I am forever thankful to my parents for the life and education they provided. My father, Binod Ghimire, is an author himself, and my mother, Beena Poudyal, is a dedicated professor. They created a home filled with books, learning, and meaningful conversations. While publishing runs in our family, this book holds special meaning for me. It represents a dream that grew in a house where books were treasured friends and wise teachers.

Growing up, my birthdays were celebrated with books instead of toys. Each book was a thoughtful gift from my mother, and together they built the foundation of knowledge you'll find in these pages. These books shaped who I am and the writer I've become.

I want to thank my beloved daughter, Aashvi Ghimire. Her arrival changed everything for me. She sparked my deep interest in the spiritual arts and set me on a path of discovery that led to this book. Without her presence, I would never have found my calling or the inspiration to write. Aashvi, thank you for the wonderful journey and the incredible life you have given me. I'm also grateful to Ms. Anita Pandit, Aashvi's mother, who completed our family.

I am deeply thankful to my respected teacher, Guru Bal Krishna Acharya. His commitment to sharing ancient wisdom has changed many lives, including mine. His decision to teach online opened doors for students like me who sought this profound knowledge. His teachings are both deep and accessible, showing that true learning has no boundaries.

I'm especially grateful for studying his exceptional books like "Laghu Jatakam" and "Laghu Parashari." These foundational texts cover everything from sacred geometry to ancient wisdom traditions. They have been essential in shaping my understanding. Without his guidance, I could not have become the practitioner I am today.

My sister, Barsha Ghimire, has always believed in me. Her unwavering faith has been my source of strength. She constantly encourages me to reach for excellence. Her playful challenge, "Mention my name when you succeed," has been our special promise. Though she didn't help write this book, her influence guides me, and her trust is the foundation I stand on.

I owe much gratitude to my friend Prem Regmi, who introduced me to this spiritual path. When I was beginning, he encouraged me to explore deeper. Despite my initial doubts, his support helped me discover my abilities. He didn't just give me a few practice readingsâ€”he gave me hundreds, which built my confidence.

Most importantly, he taught me about the power of words and the responsibility that comes with spiritual guidance. He warned me against making direct predictions about major life decisions, as these could unfairly influence someone's choices. This lesson was crucial, leading me to adopt a more ethical approach in my work.

This book's foundation comes from countless meaningful conversations that taught me the value of careful communication and ethical practice that honors each person's freedom and well-being.

To you, dear reader, as you explore this book, know that you're not just reading text. You're discovering the essence of a journey shaped by love, wisdom, and the trust of those who believed in me. Each page reflects the guidance and confidence given to me by the remarkable people who molded my path.
