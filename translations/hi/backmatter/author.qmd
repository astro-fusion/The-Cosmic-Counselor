**Bishal Ghimire** is a seasoned software developer with 16 years of professional experience in the field. His technical expertise is complemented by his passion for astrology, which he has been practicing professionally for several years now.

Bishal's journey into astrology was further enriched when he undertook a course in psychosocial counseling. This experience opened his eyes to the significant impact astrologers can have on individuals' mental health and the ethical considerations that come with this responsibility.

During his astrological counseling sessions, Bishal noticed a gap in the ethical considerations followed by most astrologers. Recognizing the importance of mental health and the need for ethical guidance in astrological practice, he decided to write a self-help guidebook for astrologers.
