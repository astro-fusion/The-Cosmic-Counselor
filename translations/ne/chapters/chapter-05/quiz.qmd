### üéØ Multiple Choice Questions {.quiz-section}

::: {.quiz-box}
**Question 1:** Which of the following is NOT an ethical principle typically emphasized in astrological practice?

::: {.quiz-options}
A) Confidentiality  
B) Honesty  
C) Predicting exact future events  
D) Non-judgmental attitude  
:::

::: {.quiz-explanation .hidden}
**Correct Answer: C**

Predicting exact future events goes against ethical astrological practice because it promotes determinism and removes client agency. Ethical astrology focuses on potential patterns and empowering clients to make informed choices, not on making definitive predictions about what will happen.

**Question 2:** A client asks you to definitively predict when they'll get married. What's the most ethical response?

::: {.quiz-options}
A) Give them a specific date based on transits  
B) Explain you can't predict exact timing, but explore relationship patterns in their chart  
C) Refuse to discuss relationships at all  
D) Make a vague prediction to satisfy them  
:::

::: {.quiz-explanation .hidden}
**Correct Answer: B**

The ethical approach acknowledges the client's desire for information while redirecting toward empowering insights. This maintains honesty about astrology's limitations while still providing valuable guidance about relationship patterns and tendencies.

**Question 3:** A long-term client asks you to share details of another client's chart because they believe it may contain information relevant to their own situation. How should you respond?

::: {.quiz-options}
A) Share only the relevant parts of the other client's chart  
B) Politely refuse and explain the importance of confidentiality  
C) Ask the other client for permission to share their chart details  
D) Ignore the request and change the subject  
:::

::: {.quiz-explanation .hidden}
**Correct Answer: B**

Confidentiality is absolute in ethical practice. Even with permission from another client, sharing chart details violates professional boundaries. The ethical response is to clearly explain why confidentiality matters and suggest the client focus on their own chart for insights.

::: {.quiz-box}
**Question 4:** Which approach best demonstrates cultural sensitivity in spiritual counseling?

::: {.quiz-options}
A) Treating all clients exactly the same regardless of background  
B) Making assumptions about clients based on their ethnicity  
C) Asking clients about their cultural background and adapting your approach accordingly  
D) Avoiding any mention of cultural differences  
:::

::: {.quiz-explanation .hidden}

Cultural sensitivity requires actively learning about and adapting to each client's unique background. This shows respect for their values and worldview while ensuring your guidance is relevant and appropriate to their context.
:::

::: {.quiz-box}

A) Only when they specifically ask for a referral  
B) When they mention any emotional difficulties  
C) When they present issues requiring medical, legal, or therapeutic expertise  
D) Never - you should handle all spiritual concerns yourself  
:::

::: {.quiz-explanation .hidden}
**Correct Answer: C**

Ethical practice requires recognizing the limits of your expertise. While spiritual counselors can address many life concerns, issues requiring specialized medical, legal, or therapeutic intervention should be referred to qualified professionals.
