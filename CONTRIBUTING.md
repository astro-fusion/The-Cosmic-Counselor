## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Content Standards

**✅ Maintain Ethical Focus**
- All content must align with ethical spiritual practice principles
- Emphasize empowerment over dependency
- Respect diverse spiritual traditions and backgrounds
- Include appropriate disclaimers for sensitive topics

**✅ Writing Style**
- Use clear, accessible language suitable for diverse audiences
- Include practical examples and real-world applications
- Maintain a compassionate, professional tone
- Avoid jargon without proper explanation

**✅ Cultural Sensitivity**
- Respect different spiritual traditions and practices
- Avoid generalizations or stereotypes
- Include diverse perspectives when possible
- Be mindful of cultural appropriation concerns

### Technical Standards

**✅ File Organization**
- Follow the established folder structure
- Use descriptive file names
- Include proper file paths in code blocks
- Maintain consistency with existing formatting

**✅ Clean & Simple Markdown Guidelines**
- **Keep files in standard Markdown**: Write content in standard, clean Markdown so non-technical authors and editors can easily read and edit files without encountering complex HTML tags or inline CSS styles.
- **Avoid Inline HTML/JS**: Do not write embedded `<button>`, `<script>`, or inline `style="..."` attributes inside `.qmd` or `.md` files.
- **Use Standard Quarto Callouts**: When visual boxes are needed, use native Quarto syntax (e.g. `::: {.callout-note}` or `::: {.highlight-box}`) rather than raw `<div>` or HTML markup.
- **Heading Hierarchy**:
  - Main chapter titles in root files use single hash `# Chapter Title` (H1).
  - Included subsections and headings use double hash `## Section Title` (H2) or triple hash `### Subsection` (H3).

```markdown
# Use consistent heading hierarchy
# Main Chapter Title (H1)
## Main Section Title (H2)
### Subsection (H3)

# Code blocks should specify language
```bash
your code here
```
```
