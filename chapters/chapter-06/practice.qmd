::: {.exercise-content}
::: {.step-box}
**Instructions:** Read each client scenario carefully. Look for both everyday stress AND potential warning signs of serious mental health issues.

- Suggest a mental health referral?

**Write your reasoning for each decision.**

**Client A - Maya, 28:** 
*"I'm so stressed about this job interview next week. I haven't been sleeping well at all - maybe 2-3 hours a night for the past month. Everything feels overwhelming right now. My boyfriend says I'm being dramatic, but I just can't stop worrying about everything. Yesterday I cried for like 3 hours straight over nothing. I feel like such a failure at everything I try."*

**Client B - David, 35:**
*"Things have been weird lately. I know someone's been following me - probably from my old job. They're definitely watching my apartment. I can hear them talking about me through the walls sometimes. My family thinks I'm paranoid, but I know what I'm experiencing. I haven't left my place much in the past few weeks because it's not safe. Can you see in my chart who's doing this to me?"*

**Client C - Sarah, 42:**
*"I've been going through a divorce, and it's been really hard. Some days I feel completely hopeless, like nothing will ever get better. I've been drinking wine every night to sleep, and my appetite is gone - I've lost about 15 pounds without trying. My kids are staying with their dad for now because I just... I can't handle taking care of anyone right now. Sometimes I wonder if they'd be better off without me."*

**Client D - Alex, 24:**
*"I need to know if Mercury retrograde is causing all this chaos in my life. Everything's been amazing lately - I haven't needed much sleep, maybe 3 hours a night, but I feel incredible! I've started three new businesses this month and I know they're all going to make me rich. My friends are being so negative about my ideas, but they just don't understand my vision. I can see connections between everything now - the universe is definitely speaking to me directly."*

**Client E - Jordan, 30:**
*"I've been feeling really anxious about social situations lately. It started a few months ago when I had a panic attack at work. Now I'm constantly worried it will happen again. I've started avoiding meetings and social events because my heart races and I can't breathe properly. I keep checking my pulse and googling heart attack symptoms. My doctor says my heart is fine, but what if they missed something?"*

*Counselor role:* This requires immediate referral. Practice staying calm while prioritizing safety.

**Scenario 3: The Resistant Client**
*Client role:* You show signs of needing help but resist suggestions about therapy, saying "I just want to know what my chart says."

*Counselor role:* Practice gentle persistence while respecting boundaries.

:::
:::

**After each roleplay, discuss:**
