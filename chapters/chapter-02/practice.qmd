### Time to get real with yourself. {.exercise-title}

These exercises aren't just homework‚Äîthey're mirrors. Be honest. Your growth as an ethical astrologer starts with acknowledging where you've been and where you want to go.

### **Exercise 1: The Instant Fix Seeker** {.exercise-title}

::: {.step-box}

**Scenario:** 

Think of a recent client who came asking questions like:

- "When exactly will I get married?"
- "Will my business succeed this year?"
- "Should I quit my job next month?"

:::

**Your Task:**

1. **Recall:** How did you respond to their urgency for immediate answers?

2. **Reflect:** Write down your exact response (be honest‚Äîno judgment here)

3. **Reimagine:** How could you have guided them toward self-discovery instead?

**Example Reframe:**

- Instead of: *"You'll meet someone in 6 months"*
- Try: *"Let's explore what qualities you're looking for in a partner and how you can cultivate them in yourself"*
